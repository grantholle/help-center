# Teams and billing

## Is Rive free?

Everybody who signs up for Rive gets access to the free Individual plan. You can create a maximum of 3 private files and share public files with the community.&#x20;

You'll need to subscribe to one of our [paid plans](../../admin/pricing/) if you're looking to share and collaborate on files within a team and to have unlimited files.

## What happens to my files if I cancel my team plan?

If you cancel, your team plan will not renew at the next billing cycle. At that moment, team members will lose the ability to edit files in the team. They will still be able to view the files, but they won't be able to make changes to them without re-activating the account.
