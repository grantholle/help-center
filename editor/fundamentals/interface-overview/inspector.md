# Inspector

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-05-25 at 3.50.12 PM.png>)

All of the editable properties of an object can be found in the Inspector. The Inspector changes dynamically depending on what object you have selected as well as where you are in the editor.&#x20;

## Transform properties

The transform properties of an object appear at the top of the inspector. Generally, these properties include position, scale, and rotation, but can also include width and height if you have a path layer selected.

## Layer properties

Below the transform properties, you'll find a number of properties that allow you to customize the look of some objects on the stage. These properties include blend mode, opacity, fill, and stroke.
