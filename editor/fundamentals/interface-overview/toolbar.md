The Transform Tools menu houses tools that allow you to alter the transform properties of an object directly on the Stage.

The Select tool allows you to click and drag in an empty space to select multiple objects with a marquee. You can also click and drag directly on items to manipulate them. In most cases, you'll probably be using the Select tool.

When you have objects selected with the Select tool, you'll see the Gizmo which gives you the power to change the position, scale, and rotation of the object.

## **Create Tools menu**
