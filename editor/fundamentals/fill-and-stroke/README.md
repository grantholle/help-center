## **Fill**

The Fill section of the Inspector allows you to add and modify the fill properties of the currently selected object. You can create as many fills as you like.

### **Fill type**

- Linear gradient
- Radial gradient

### **Fill rule**

The Fill Rule determines how overlapping paths in a shape will be filled:

- **Non-Zero** fills the entire shape, including any overlapping paths.
- **Even-Odd** does not fill the holes in overlapping paths.

The Cap option determines how the endpoints of strokes with open paths should be rendered.

- **Butt**\
  \*\*\*\*The end of the stroke is a straight line and does not extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke will not be rendered at all.
- **Round**\
  \*\*\*\*The ends of a stroke are rounded. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a full circle.
- **Square**\
  \*\*\*\*The ends of a stroke are squared off and extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a square.

### **Join**

- **Bevel** creates a beveled corner.
- **Miter** creates a mitered corner.
