# Share Links

## Sharing with others

There are a number of ways to share your Rive creation with others. One of which is the "Share Links" button in the export menu dropdown of the Rive editor. These links can be shared with anyone you send them to.

Once you click this option, a new modal will appear where you can choose which artboard and animation or state machine to play.

### Different share links

Once you click on the "Generate link" button at the bottom, you should be presented with three options for sharing:

* **Share link** - Displayed within a border frame on the Rive site at a unique URL. Use this for quickly showing off your Rive creation to clients without having to stage it within the context of a web application yourself
* **Embed link** - Standalone display of your Rive creation without the context of the border frame. Use this link when you want to embed your Rive creation into other 3rd party platforms that support unfurling and displaying your Rive creation still as a preview (i.e Notion, Tome, Telegram)
* **Embed code** - A code snippet that allows you to embed your Rive creation's embed link in an iframe. This is useful for where you need to drop Rive into a platform where you can edit HTML (i.e Webflow, WordPress, etc.) and you don't want to deal with setting up the creation with a web runtime

### Managing share links

In the modal where the 3 share link options are presented, you also have the option to manage all the share links you have generated. Here, you can see when the share link was generated, and have the ability to toggle off the active state. By toggling this state off, the link to your Rive creation will make it non-public.\

Additionally, in the manage share links modal, you will see all the different share link URL's you have generated.
