# Timeline

The Rive interface displays a timeline with playback controls and options for the current animation in Animate mode. A list of all animations is displayed to the left of the Timeline. Keep in mind that these are animations for the currently [active artboard](../fundamentals/artboards/#active-artboard).

## **Animation type**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/animation\_type.png)

**One-Shot**\
****Playhead stops at the end of the animation.

**Ping-Pong**\
****The playhead continuously plays from the start-point to the end-point, and back from the endpoint to the start point.

**Loop**\
****The playhead continuously loops the animation from the start point to the endpoint.

**Work Area**\
****The work area is used to define the playback area of an animation. Work areas are an easy way to focus on a small portion of a larger animation.

## **Timeline Options**

Located to the right of the playback select, the Timeline Options show you the current time, duration, playback speed, and snap keys options.

\
**Current**\
****The current position of the playhead.

**Duration**\
****The total length of the timeline.

**Playback Speed**\
****The speed at which the animation should play. The default speed is 1x. Negative values cause the animation to play backward.

**Snap Keys**\
****The interval at which keys can be placed on the Timeline. By default, keys can be set at a subdivision of 60 for each second.

## **Navigating the Timeline**

**Scroll and Zoom**\
****Use the horizontal scrollbar at the top of the Timeline (with two grabbers on each side) to scroll and resize the zoom level of the Timeline.

**Pan**\
****You can also use the same pan shortcuts as the stage to pan the Timeline (right-click and drag, or hold spacebar and drag).\
