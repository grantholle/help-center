# Pricing

Rive is free for individuals and supports paid plans for teams. Teams allow you to create a shared space where you and other team members can collaborate in real-time, no matter where you are. We offer flexible plan options and our [fair billing policy](fair-billing-policy.md) means you'll only be billed for users as you add them, and when you remove a user we'll give the prorated credit back to you.

## Individual plan

Every user that signs up for Rive has an individual area where they can create a maximum of 3 files.

**Free**

## Studio plan

The Studio plan allows you to create a space where you and other members of your team can share files and collaborate in real-time. All paid accounts have unlimited files.
