# State Machines

For more information on designing and building state machines in Rive, please refer to the [editor's state machine section](https://app.gitbook.com/@rive/s/rive-help-center/editor/animate-mode/state-machine).

Rive's state machines provide a way to combine a set of animations and manage the transition between them through a series of inputs that can be programmatically controlled. Once a state machine is instantiated and playing, transitioning states can be accomplished by changing boolean or double value inputs, or firing triggers. The effects of these will be dependent on how the state machine has been configured in the editor.

## Playing state machines

State machines are instantiated in much the same manner as animations: provide the state machine name to the Rive object:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web" %}
```javascript
const r = new rive.Rive({
    src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
    canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
    autoplay: true,
    stateMachines: 'bumpy',
    fit: rive.Fit.cover,
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Flutter" %}
```dart
RiveAnimation.network(
    'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
    fit: BoxFit.cover,
    stateMachines: ['bumpy'],
);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once the Rive file is loaded and instantiated, the state machine can be queried for inputs, and these inputs can then be read from and written to, and in the case of triggers, fired.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web" %}
The web runtime provides an `onLoad` callback that's run when the Rive file is loaded and ready for use. We use this here to ensure that the state machine is instantiated when we query for inputs.

```markup
<div id="button">
    <canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="500"></canvas>
</div>
<script src="/dist/rive.min.js"></script>
<script>
    const button = document.getElementById('button');

    const r = new rive.Rive({
        src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
        canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
        autoplay: true,
        stateMachines: 'bumpy',
        fit: rive.Fit.cover,
        onLoad: (_) => {
            const inputs = r.stateMachineInputs('bumpy');
            const bumpTrigger = inputs.find(i => i.name === 'bump');
            button.onclick = () => bumpTrigger.fire();
        },
    });
</script>
```

We use the `stateMachineInputs` function on the Rive object to retrieve the inputs. Each input will have a name and type. There are three types:

* `StateMachineInputType.Trigger` which has a `fire()` function
* `StateMachineInputType.Number` which has a `value` number property
* `StateMachineInputType.Boolean` which has a `value` boolean property

```javascript
const inputs = r.stateMachineInputs('bumpy');
inputs.forEach(i => {
    const inputName = i.name;
    const inputType = i.type;
    switch(inputType) {
        case rive.StateMachineInputType.Trigger:
            i.fire();
            break;
        case rive.StateMachineInputType.Number:
            i.value = 42;
            break;
        case rive.StateMachineInputType.Boolean:
            i.value = true;
            break;
    }
});
```

We can set a callback to determine when the state machine changes state. `onStateChange` provides an `event` parameter that gives us the name of the current state:

```javascript
const r = new rive.Rive({
    src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
    canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
    autoplay: true,
    stateMachines: 'bumpy',
    onStateChange: (event) => {
        stateName.innerHTML = event.data[0];
    },
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Flutter" %}
State machine controllers are used to retrieve a state machine's inputs which can then be used to interact with, and drive the state of, the state machine.

State machine controllers require a reference to an artboard when being instantiated. The `RiveAnimation` widget provides a callback `onInit(Artboard artboard)` that is called when the Rive file has loaded and is initialized for playback:

```dart
void _onRiveInit(Artboard artboard) {}

RiveAnimation.network(
    'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
    fit: BoxFit.cover,
    onInit: _onRiveInit,
);
```

Now that we have an artboard, we can create an instance of a `StateMachineController` and from that, retrieve the inputs we're interested in. Specific inputs can be retrieved using `findInput()` or all inputs with the `inputs` property.

```dart
SMITrigger? _bump;

void _onRiveInit(Artboard artboard) {
    final controller = StateMachineController.fromArtboard(artboard, 'bumpy');
    artboard.addController(controller!);
    _bump = controller.findInput<bool>('bump') as SMITrigger;
}
```

Here we retrieve the `bump` input, which is an `SMITrigger`. This type of input has a `fire()` method to activate the trigger. There are two other input types: `SMIBool` and `SMINumber`. These both have a `value` property that can get and set the value.

```dart
class SimpleStateMachine extends StatefulWidget {
  const SimpleStateMachine({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SimpleStateMachineState createState() => _SimpleStateMachineState();
}

class _SimpleStateMachineState extends State<SimpleStateMachine> {
  SMITrigger? _bump;

  void _onRiveInit(Artboard artboard) {
    final controller = StateMachineController.fromArtboard(artboard, 'bumpy');
    artboard.addController(controller!);
    _bump = controller.findInput<bool>('bump') as SMITrigger;
  }

  void _hitBump() => _bump?.fire();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Simple Animation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          child: RiveAnimation.network(
            'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
            onInit: _onRiveInit,
          ),
          onTap: _hitBump,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the complete example above, every time the `RiveAnimation` is tapped, it fires the `bump` input trigger, and the state machine reacts appropriately, in this case mixing in a bump animation.

If you'd like to know which state a state machine is in, or when a state machine transitions to another state, you can provide a callback to `StateMachineController`. The callback has the name of the state machine and the name of the animation associated with the current state:

```dart
 void _onRiveInit(Artboard artboard) {
  final controller = StateMachineController.fromArtboard(
    artboard,
    'bumpy',
    onStateChange: _onStateChange,
  );
  artboard.addController(controller!);
  _bump = controller.findInput<bool>('bump') as SMITrigger;
}

void _onStateChange(
  String stateMachineName,
  String stateName,
) =>
    setState(
      () => message = 'State Changed in $stateMachineName to $stateName',
    );
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
